# Hi, I'm Anastasia

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science. Over the years, I've completed certifications and projects that helped me build strong skills in programming, data analysis, and machine learning. My most recent achievement is completing the **Data Analytics certification from Turing College** (March 2025), a comprehensive program that equipped me with diverse data-relevant skills.

I also hold three certifications from freeCodeCamp in **Scientific Computing with Python**, **Data Analysis with Python**, and **Machine Learning with Python**, which provided a solid foundation for my technical expertise.
